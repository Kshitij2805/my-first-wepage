        <p>Anime (US: /ˈænəmeɪ/, UK: /ˈænɪmeɪ/;[1] Japanese: アニメ [aɲime] (About this soundlisten), plural: anime),[a] sometimes called Japanimation,[2][3][4] is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. The term anime is derived from the English word animation, and in Japan is used to refer to all forms of animated media.[5] Outside Japan, the term refers specifically to animation from Japan or to a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.[6][7] This culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan.[8][9][10]

The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread in the second half of the 20th century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime can be distributed theatrically, by way of television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to completely original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (known as manga), light novels, or video games.</p>
